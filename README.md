This Project was carried out to test and demonstrate the understanding of Object-Oriented Programming Principles in JavaScript and its application in Real life.

## Usage

- clone the repository and cd into the directory such that you are on `OOP-Implementation-Animal-Kingdom`
- To run this code, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed
- use the following command to run the code on your terminal

## Lesson Learnt

1. Great understanding of the OOP principles:

- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation and
- Polymorphism;

2. Vast application of Object-Oriented Programming;
3. The proper application of Classes.

4. Object-Oriented Analysis(OOA) and Object-Oriented Designs(OOD) has taught me the importance of paying attention to details while drawing the Use Case Diagram and the Class Diagram as wrong design
   results to wrong code.
